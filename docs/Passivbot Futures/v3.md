# Version 3

As version 3 is still under active testing and development, these documents are updated periodically. Refer to version 2 for the most stable releases.

## Configuration (live config)  

Note that the live_settings configuration file is a JSON file, while the backtest_configs configuration file is an HJSON.


**config_name**

arbitrary name given to config

**logging_level**

set to 0, no logging.  set to 1, logs positions, open orders, order creations, order cancellations to `logs/{exchange}/{config_name}.log`

**ddown_factor**

`reentry_qty = psize * ddown_factor`

e.g. if pos size is 0.4 and ddown factor is 0.5, reentry qty is 0.2

**qty_pct**

`initial_entry_qty = max(min_qty, balance_in_terms_of_contracts * leverage * qty_pct * (1 + volatility * volatility_qty_coeff))`

**leverage**

`max_pos_size = balance_in_terms_of_contracts * leverage`

**grid_spacing**

`reentry_price = pprice * (1 +- grid_spacing * grid_spacing_modifier)`

**pos_margin_grid_coeff and volatility_grid_coeff**

`grid_spacing_modifier = (1 + (pos_margin / wallet_balance) * pos_margin_grid_coeff) * (1 + volatility * volatility_grid_coeff)`

where `volatility = std(last_n_ticks) / ema(last_n_ticks)`

where `last_n_ticks = ema_span`

a tick is defined as a tick whose price is different from previous tick's price

**volatility_qty_coeff**

used in initial_entry_qty calc, see qty_pct above

**min_markup**

positions are closed at min markup: `first_close_price = pprice * (1 +- min_markup)

**markup_range**

if markup_range > 0, splits closing orders into multiple closing orders from min_markup to (min_markup + markup_range)

**do_long**

if true, allows initial long entries

**do_shrt**

if true, allows initial short entries

**ema_span**

span used to calc ema: `next_ema = prev_ema * (1 - alpha) + price * alpha`

where `alpha = 2 / (ema_span + 1)`

**ema_spread**

initial_{long or shrt}_entry_price = `min({highest_bid or lowest_ask}, ema * (1 {+ or -} ema_spread))`

**stop_loss_liq_diff**

```
if diff(liq_price, last_market_price) < stop_loss_liq_diff:
    if hedge mode and available margin:
        create opposite side entry
    else:
        create same side close
```

**stop_loss_pos_pct**

stop_loss_qty = psize * stop_loss_pos_pct






## Configuration (backtest config)  


**session_name**

arbitrary name

**exchange**

binance or bybit

**user**

set your account name here, needed to fetch ticks

**symbol**

symbol to backtest.  note differences between USDT margined symbols (ends with USDT) and inverse symbols (ends with USD).  also note difference between binance inverse perpetual and inverse futures (e.g. ETHUSD_PERP or ETHUSD_210625)

**latency_simulation_ms**

simulate latency between bot and exchange

**starting_balance**

starting balance in margin token (USDT in linear markets, coin in inverse markets)

**do_long/do_shrt**

allow long/short positions

**pso options**

particle swarm optimization options

iters: n backtests

num_cpus: max n cpus for parallel testing

options: c1, c2, w.   pso specific options, see for example https://pymoo.org/algorithms/pso.html for more info

n_particles: n particles, see above link for more info

**minimum_liquidation_distance**

optimizer will penalize configs whose liquidation in backtests came closer than given threshold

**max_n_hours_between_fills**

optimizer will penalize configs whose max duration between consecutive fills in backtest was higher than given threshold

**start_date/end_date**

timeframe to backtest

**ranges**

search space for each tunable parameter.  if min and max are equal, parameter is fixed and not tuned.
