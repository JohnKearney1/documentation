## Abstract

PassivBot Version 2 is here! This version introduces a batch of new features, stability fixes, optimizations, behavioral changes, and more. For a full list of changes, see the changelog. Some highlights:

- Dockerization  
- Speed Increases Over v1
- Improved Documentation
- Versioning Implemented
- Major Backtester Overhaul
- Minor Re-factoring
- New Usage Syntax
- Community Updates

Releases:
**[v2.0.0](https://github.com/enarjord/passivbot_futures/releases/tag/v2.0.0)** **|** **[v2.1.0](https://github.com/enarjord/passivbot_futures/releases/tag/v2.1.0)**

## Setup  

1. Clone or download your desired release from the [GitHub](https://github.com/enarjord/passivbot_futures/)

2. Install the dependencies from the root folder of the download using:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`


3. Add your API Keys to the appropriate directory as JSON files:

 - Binance: `api_key_secrets/binance/{USERNAME}.json`  
 - ByBit: `api_key_secrets/binance/{USERNAME}.json`  


  When creating API key files, the file-name will be your "username", and the keys should be provided as a string list object in the format: `["API_KEY", "API_KEY_SECRET"]`. A template file is provided as an example.


## Configuration (backtest_configs)

A template backtest configuration file is provided as a reference. It's suggested simply to duplicate the provided hjson file, rename it, and edit the necessary parameters. The name of your backtest configuration file is arbitrary, so long as there are no spaces.

Additionally, some values within conditions may be augmented to more accurately define expected results.                           	| String Array (various) 	|
| `ranges:`                      	| All range variables are presented in a standard format: [`MIN-VALUE` , `MAX-VALUE`, `STEP`]. The MIN-VALUE is the smallest allowable value, the MAX-VALUE is the maximum allowable value, and the STEP indicates the smallest allowed specificity in generated values.                                                                   	| Integer Array          	|

| `market_stop_loss`                             	| Specifies whether the bot is allowed to use market orders to preform stop losses when necessary.

## Jupyter-Lab (Backtest Analysis)  

You must install [`Jupyter-Lab`](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html#pip) to use the included .ipynb files.

1. Open `backtest_notes.ipynb` in Jupyter, and navigate to cell 5, line 1:

2. Replace the `backtest_config_name` string with the name of your `backtest_config` configuration file. Do not include the file extension.

  ![Backtest Notes](img/BacktestNotes.png)

3. Return focus to cell 1, and use `Shift + Enter` to step through each cell sequentially. The cell number will change from `[1]` to `[*]` while the process is executing. When execution of the highlighted cell is complete, it will change back to the cell number and you may continue.

Stepping through each cell will save the associated data or file to the directory where the backtest results are located: `backtest_results/{exchange}/{symbol}/{session_name}`. Example backtest data is available [here](https://github.com/JohnKearney1/PassivBot-Configurations).


## Usage  

Note that your `{username}` is both the name of your API KeyFile, *and* your live_settings configuration file. These files should have identical names, without spaces. To run the bot, navigate to the root directory in a command prompt and run the associated command(s):

**Backtest ->** `python3 backtest.py {backtest_config filename} {optional: --jit}`  
**Live Bot ->** `python3 start_bot.py {exchange} {username}`  
**Jupyter-Lab ->** `jupyter-lab` *(From root dir.)*
